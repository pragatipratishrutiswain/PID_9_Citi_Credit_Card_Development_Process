## Objective
To design the credit card, we will need to come up with a customer-led proposition while thinking outside the box and revolutionize Citi's product offering to better align with the evolving customer needs.

## Action
Launch a new personal branded credit card better suited to its customer needs.

## Task
- Create questionnaire for a “Loyal-Customer" to better understand the customer needs.<br>
(A Loyal-Customer is a valued customer since 2011 or before, who has agreed to respond the team.)
- Gather critical customer information (such as customer needs, customer preferences, customer profile, etc.) from the Loyal-Customer to design the Credit Card.
